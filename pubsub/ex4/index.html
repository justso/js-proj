    Option 4: Third-party Plugins A number of jQuery plugins have been written
    which provide a pub/sub implementation free of reliance on
    .bind()/.trigger() (and consequently .on()/.off). Should you wish to use
    one of these solutions, I'm happy to recommend Peter Higgin's plugin
    available here:

    There are of course many, many library agnostic Pub/Sub implementations
    that have been written (Shameless plug: I've also done one
    https://github.com/addyosmani/pubsubz/), but this rough guide will be
    focusing on jQuery for the most part. Here's Peter's implementation and a
    demo:
