    Option 2: Custom events using .on() and .off():

    In jQuery 1.7, we updated the events API to support two new methods: .on()
    and .off(). These methods are meant to simplify the usage of
    .bind(),.live() and .delegate() such that rather than relying on
    developers to know which of these options is the best to use, all
    developers can simply use .on() and .off() and we'll make the best logic
    decisions for what to use beneath the hood. Note: As of jQuery 1.7 all of
    these three methods (bind/live/delegate) use .on() and .off() when you
    call them, so calling these newer methods directly is advised.

    Here's Ben Alman's really tiny pub/sub with my (minor) 1.7 updates from
    https://gist.github.com/1319216. The link to his gist with lots of useful
    comments is here: https://gist.github.com/661855
