Option 2: Custom events using .on() and .off():
In jQuery 1.7, we updated the events API to support two new methods: .on() and
.off(). These methods are meant to simplify the usage of .bind(),.live() and
.delegate() such that rather than relying on developers to know which of these
options is the best to use, all developers can simply use .on() and .off() and
we'll make the best logic decisions for what to use beneath the hood. Note: As
of jQuery 1.7 all of these three methods (bind/live/delegate) use .on() and
.off() when you call them, so calling these newer methods directly is advised.

Here's Ben Alman's really tiny pub/sub with my (minor) 1.7 updates from
https://gist.github.com/1319216. The link to his gist with lots of useful
comments is here: https://gist.github.com/661855
